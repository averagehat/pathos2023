/*
This is a read from a ReadSet.  This base class will be used longernally
by the ReadSet and will be extended to include the features of a ScoredSeq.

SPEC FIELDS:
readSet: the ReadSet from which this BareRead derives
specifier: an identifier to distinguish this BareRead from other
   BareReads from the same ReadSet

ABSTRACTION FUNCTION:
ReadSet readSetVar -> a reference to the instance of ReadSet from which 
   this BareRead derives
long specifierVar -> the unique id for this BaseRead within readSet

REP. INVARIANT:
-this BareRead must be a member of readSet

-because this is carrying a polonger, the copy constructor, copy assignment
 operator, and destructor must all be implemented.
